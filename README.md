# Week 1 Homework

## Description

This is a rewrite of code that's been provided to improve accessibility.

- The motivation behind this project is to practice HTML and CSS skills.
- I built this project as a way to work on semantics in code and work on some basic bug fixing.
- This solves the problem of learning without hands on practice. Without hands on experience, knowledge remains stagnent.
- I learned a few semantic elements in HTML and a basic layout of a homepage.
